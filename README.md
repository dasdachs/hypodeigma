# Hypodeima

> The ancient Greek word for template is ὑπόδειγμα (hypodeigma), which means "example" or "model". 

This project is a simple starter generator written in Go. It's designed to help you quickly bootstrap any project written in any language and/or framework.

The starters are bootstrapped using the [go template language](https://pkg.go.dev/text/template) and a [yaml](https://yaml.org/spec/).
